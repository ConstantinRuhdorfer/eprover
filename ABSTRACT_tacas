The artifact we submit is E 2.3, the prover whose implementation
we describe in the paper 'Extending a Brainiac Prover to Lambda-Free 
Higher-Order Logic'. It is written in C and has no external dependencies.
E 2.3 is an extension of E 2.2 to a fragment
of a higher logic that we describe in aforementioned paper. It outperforms
encoding-based approaches to higher-order theorem proving.
Furthermore, it incurs almost no overhead when compared to its basis, E 2.2. 
Our changes are integrated in the main line of
E and the latest version can always be obtained from
