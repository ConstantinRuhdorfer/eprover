Signature extension with OCB: Standard weight and Precedence -> done

If parsing literals and clauses into terms is to slow: Extend
signature for fast access to internal symbols $eq, $neq, $null, $or,
$or_i. -> Done, and better ;-)

Literal Splitting a la Vampire (P(X) v Q(Y) -> P(X) v A1, Q(Y) v A2,
-A1 v -A2) (also works (with non-ground connection literal) if
literals are not variable disjunct) -> Done for the variable disjoint
case. 

Subsumption with Pre-Match -> Done

Literal selection as in SPASS: Select only if more than one maximal
literal. -> Done

For evaluation of clauses, do output subsumption inferences
(equivalent to rewriting). -> Done

More testruns, prefer positive literals (This is counterintuitive to
me, but seems to work for some examples). -> Done

Check unprocessed clauses for identical copies! -> Done

Rework subsumption: 
       1) Use an array to keep track of picked-level -> done
       2) Use real renaming test for subsumption -> done
       3) Does s or s subsume s or t ? -> Logically yes, but this is
          not allowed in superposition, as s or s is not a
          multi-subset of s or t!

More important: Make distribute-eprover check bug-conditions and
memory overflows! -> done

Implement a heuristic taking size and proof length into account. ->
Done!

Output of inferences/evaluations -> done
Output of rewrite steps -> done
For proof analysis and extraction: Keep track of clauses and _terms_
occuring in the proof.
--> Use internal minimal array should work...
  -> Done

Inherit selection property/Inherit paramodulation-into-property
(i.e. select always the same literal in newly generated clauses as in
the primary parent) -->done

Use selection functions based on equality status (prefer
equality/non-equality literals) --> done

Linearity as heuristic measure... -> Done

Avoid recursive descent if only NEQ units in index.
--> tried, no benefit, as we still need to update weights and normal
    form status

Select literal with minimal number of inference positions (i.e. sum of
size of maximal sides) -> Done, unimpressive

Inherit paramod-literal on goals (or potentially other clause types
(e.g. Non-Horn, or everything that cannot degenerate to a positive
unit easily)) only!  -> Done (for goals)

Select positive literals in Horn clauses, negatives only otherwise! 
-> Done, not very good

PNWeight: Give different weight to variables and function symbols
depending on wether they occur in positive or negative literals. ->
Done, sometimes ok, but not a big deal
