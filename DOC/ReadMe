This is the required ReadMe file for the CASC competitions.
-----------------------------------------------------------

For installation, follow the instructions in the main README
file. Make sure to do a proper install, so that eproof and
e_ltb_runner can find the executables.


Command line:

   eprover -xAuto -tAuto --tstp-in -s --memory-limit=3072 %s

   eproof  -xAuto -tAuto --tstp-in --tstp-out --memory-limit=3072 %s

For the LTB category, run

    e_ltb_runner <path_to_ltb_batch_file> <path_to_eprover> <path_to_epclextract>


Distinguished strings for the results:

Problem is CNF and unsatisfiable:

# SZS status Unsatisfiable

Problem is CNF and satisfiable:

# SZS status Satisfiable

Problem is FOF and a theorem: 

# SZS status Theorem

Problem is FOF and not a theorem:

# SZS status CounterSatisfiable

System gave up (usually resource limit)

# Failure:


The start of solution output for proofs:

# SZS output start CNFRefutation.

The end of solution output for proofs:

# SZS output end CNFRefutation.




The start of solution output for models/saturations:

# SZS output start Saturation.

The end of solution output for models/saturations:

# SZS output end Saturation.



LTB Problem processing:
# SZS status Started for <name>
# SZS status Ended for <name>
