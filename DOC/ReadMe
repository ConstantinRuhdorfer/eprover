This is the required ReadMe file for the CASC competitions.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Do:
   gtar xzf E.tgz
   cd E
   more README

Follow the instructions you find there.

Translating to input format:

   None required, E reads TPTP-3 format with includes

Command line:

   eprover -xAuto -tAuto --tstp-in -s --memory-limit=384 %s

   eproof  -xAuto -tAuto --tstp-in --tstp-out --memory-limit=384 %s


Distinguished strings for the results:

Problem is CNF and unsatisfiable:

# TSTP exit status: Unsatisfiable

Problem is CNF and satisfiable:

# TSTP exit status: Satisfiable

Problem is FOF and a theorem: 

# TSTP exit status: Theorem

Problem is FOF and not a theorem:

# TSTP exit status: CounterSatisfiable

- System gave up (usually resource limit)

# Failure:

Please remind the TSTP people that TSTP exit statuses have to become
hierarchic! 

The start of solution output:

# Proof object starts here.

The end of solution output:

# Proof object ends here.
