EVALUATION MANUAL
=================

Installation
------------

1) Move to the eprover/ directory of the submitted archive.
2) Run ./local_build

As a result two binaries will be created in eprover/bin directory:
  1) eprover-fo : this binary runs E 2.3 in FOL mode
  2) eprover-ho : this binary runs E 2.3 in LFHOL mode


Problems
--------

Directory problems/ contains the problems used in our experimentation.
In the following we describe the structure of its subdirectories that
contain different categories of the problems we evaluated our
artifact on:

      problems/      | all problems
        | app/       |   applicatively encoded problems
          | SH_HO/   |     Sledgehammer higher-order problems
            | 512/   |       512 facts
            | 32/    |       32 facts
          | SH_FO/   |     Sledgehammer first-order problems
            | 512/   |       512 facts
            | 32/    |       32 facts
          | TPTP_FO/ |     First order untyped TPTP problems
            | tff/   |     First order typed TPTP problems
          | LFHOL/   |     LFHOL TPTP problems
        | fo/        |   first-order problems
          | SH_FO    |     Sledgehammer first-order problems
            | 512    |       512 facts
            | 32     |       32 facts
          | TPTP_FO  |     First order untyped TPTP problems
            | tff    |     First order typed TPTP problems
        | ho/        |   higher-order problems
          | SH_HO    |     Sledgehammer higher-order problems
            | 512    |       512 facts
            | 32     |       32 facts
          | LFHOL    |     Higher order untyped TPTP problems
        

Configurations
--------------

The archive contains 7 different configurations which we used
to evaluate E 2.3:

1) a_ho.sh: Auto mode, LFHOL version
2) a_fo.sh: Auto mode, FOL version
3) as_ho.sh: Auto-schedule mode, LFHOL version
4) as_fo.sh: Auto-schedule mode, FOL version
5) b_ho.sh: Best-of-manual, LFHOL version
6) b_ho_ho.sh: Best-of-manual_ho, LFHOL version
7) b_fo.sh: Best-of-manual, FOL version

Running the experiments
-----------------------

To run the experiments automatically we have prepared the script
run_configuration.py that runs selected configuration on
all files in the selected folder. More precisely

  "python3 run_configuration.py <configuration_file CF> <root_folder RF> <timeout T> <results_file RES_F>"

will run E using configuration CF on all files in hierarchy RF with the CPU limtit T.
The results will be saved in the file RES_F. Results will contain the path to the
problem, answer (status) of the prover and  time the prover took to finish.
When the script finishes, a small summary will be printed that contains the number
of problems on which each prover reported a certain status.

Important: You need to be positioned in eprover/bin/ directory to run configurations. 

An example run is:

  "python3 run_configuration.py ./a_ho.sh ./problems/ho/LFHOL 60 lfhol_res.csv"
